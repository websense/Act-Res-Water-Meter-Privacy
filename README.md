Code and sample data for "Activity and Resolution Aware Privacy Protection for Smart Water Meter Databases" 
2022

Abstract: 
Identifying water end-uses from household meter readings yields valuable commercial and environmental insights for both customers and water providers. But smart water meter databases may expose sensitive information about the activities of metered households, thus raising privacy concerns that limit the possibility of making smart meter data available for research and planning. This paper considers the case where a water provider wishes to publish a database of household water meter traces to be used by water analysts, who are often external entities, for research and planning purposes. Hence, the scenario presents risks to privacy should an adversary gain access to this database, with the threat of uniquely identifying a household of interest and exposing their water use activities. Therefore, this paper proposes a process for activity-aware privacy protection and evaluates its effectiveness using real-world and synthetic databases.  Our experimental analysis shows that water meters privacy-protection is strongly dependent on the type of activity, temporal resolution and population size.  In the case of high resolution data, we found that a large base population, small published sample and 30 second resolution provided optimal trade-offs between privacy and utility.  For low resolution data and a population of over 3500 households, 1 hour resolution provided strong utility and customizable privacy guarantees depending on the published sample size.
